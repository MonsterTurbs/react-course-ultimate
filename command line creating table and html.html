   
 Create a print-friendly HTML page from the lecture/transcript I will provide.
 Convert the content into a reviewer / study guide with beginner-friendly explanations and examples where appropriate.
 Include icons and emoticons to improve readability and retention.
 Use a white background and ensure the page is A4 print-ready for standard white bond paper.
 Use a single-column layout only.
 Ensure word wrapping and spacing so that text does not get cut off when printed.
 Include print-specific CSS (margins, font sizing, line height) for clean print output.
