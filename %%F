<!--
Create a print-friendly HTML page from the lecture/transcript I will provide.
Convert the content into a reviewer / study guide with beginner-friendly explanations and examples where appropriate.
Include icons and emoticons to improve readability and retention.
Use a white background and ensure the page is A4 print-ready for standard white bond paper.
Use a single-column layout only.
Ensure word wrapping and spacing so that text does not get cut off when printed.
Include print-specific CSS (margins, font sizing, line height) for clean print output.
